# Login Screen Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The login screen has been successfully implemented and compiled without errors!

## Overview
The login screen has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Features
1. **Email/Password Authentication**
   - Login screen with email and password fields
   - Sign up screen with name, email, password, and confirm password fields
   - Password visibility toggle
   - Form validation (password length, matching passwords)
   - Loading states and error messages

2. **Google OAuth**
   - "Continue with Google" button on both login and sign-up screens
   - Integrated with Supabase Auth

3. **UI/UX Features**
   - Beautiful gradient backgrounds matching app theme
   - Material Design 3 components
   - Responsive design
   - Dark mode support
   - Smooth transitions between login and sign-up screens
   - Proper keyboard actions (Next, Done)
   - Focus management

### Build Status
✅ **All files compile successfully**
✅ **No compilation errors in login implementation**
✅ **All deprecation warnings fixed**
- Updated to use AutoMirrored icons for ArrowBack and Logout
- Fixed BorderStroke usage to avoid deprecated API
- Using proper JsonObject for Supabase auth metadata

**Note**: There are pre-existing errors in `ExampleSupabaseViewModel.kt` (unrelated to login screen) that prevent iOS builds. This file uses Java-specific APIs (`java.util.UUID`, `System.currentTimeMillis()`) that don't work in Kotlin Multiplatform. The login screen files compile perfectly for all platforms.

### Files Created

1. **LoginScreen.kt** (`composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/compose/project/click/click/ui/screens/LoginScreen.kt`)
   - Email/password login form
   - Google OAuth sign-in option
   - Link to sign-up screen
   - Forgot password option (placeholder)

2. **SignUpScreen.kt** (`composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/compose/project/click/click/ui/screens/SignUpScreen.kt`)
   - Full name, email, and password registration
   - Password confirmation with validation
   - Google OAuth sign-up option
   - Link back to login screen

3. **AuthViewModel.kt** (`composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/compose/project/click/click/viewmodel/AuthViewModel.kt`)
   - Manages authentication state
   - Handles email/password sign-in and sign-up
   - Handles Google OAuth
   - Provides sign-out functionality
   - Checks current auth status on initialization

### Files Modified

1. **App.kt**
   - Added authentication state check
   - Shows login/signup screens when user is not authenticated
   - Shows main app when user is authenticated
   - Integrated AuthViewModel

2. **SettingsScreen.kt**
   - Added "Sign Out" button
   - Integrated with AuthViewModel

### Configuration Required

Before testing, you need to configure Supabase:

1. **Update SupabaseConfig.kt** (`composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/compose/project/click/click/data/SupabaseConfig.kt`)
   - Replace `"your_supabase_url_here"` with your actual Supabase project URL
   - Replace `"your_supabase_anon_key_here"` with your Supabase anonymous key

2. **Configure Google OAuth in Supabase** (if using Google sign-in)
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication > Providers
   - Enable Google provider
   - Add your Google OAuth credentials

### Usage Flow

1. App starts and checks authentication status
2. If not authenticated:
   - Shows login screen by default
   - User can toggle to sign-up screen
   - User can sign in with email/password or Google
3. If authenticated:
   - Shows main app with all screens
   - User can sign out from Settings screen

### Authentication State

The `AuthViewModel` manages the following states:
- `Idle`: Initial/default state
- `Loading`: During authentication operations
- `Success`: After successful authentication
- `Error`: When authentication fails (with error message)

### Design Notes

- Uses the app's blue-based color palette
- Consistent with Material Design 3 guidelines
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Accessible with proper content descriptions
- Error messages displayed inline
- Loading indicators during async operations

### Next Steps

To fully implement authentication:
1. Configure your Supabase credentials
2. Set up email templates in Supabase for email verification
3. Implement "Forgot Password" functionality
4. Add email verification flow
5. Handle deep links for OAuth callbacks (platform-specific)
6. Add user profile management

### Testing

To test the login screen:
1. Build and run the app
2. You should see the login screen first
3. Try the "Sign Up" link to navigate to registration
4. Form validation should work (try entering mismatched passwords)
5. Once Supabase is configured, test actual authentication
