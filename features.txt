Part 1: The Core Product (The MVP)
The Problem
The "Connection Graveyard": Students meet, exchange Instagrams, and never talk again.

Passive Doomscrolling: Social media is designed for consumption, not connection.

Performative Culture: Profiles are curated stages, creating FOMO and isolation.

Misaligned Incentives: Users are the product; data is sold to advertisers.

The Solution: Click
A privacy-first utility that turns fleeting handshakes into lasting friendships.

Core Features:

NFC/QR Contact Exchange: The "Digital Handshake." Users tap phones or scan QR codes to exchange profiles instantly. No searching usernames.

Contextual Tagging: Every connection is tagged with where and when you met (e.g., "Met at Dawg Daze," "Met at CSE 142").

The "Vibe Check" (Timed Chat): The app initiates a 30-minute timed chat (text or video).

Mutual Opt-In: At the end of 30 minutes, the chat is deleted by default unless both users click "Keep." This ensures mutual interest.

No Feed: The app has no scrolling feed. It is a tool for active connection, not passive consumption.

Visual Identity:

Color: Vibrant, energetic Violet (#8338EC).

Typography: Clean, modern sans-serif font.
